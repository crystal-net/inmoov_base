Try to run the launch script with Gazebo commented out and see
if the same messages get posted with rViz2 running.  This might
show that it is Gazebo_Ros2_controller that is doing it and maybe I just move forward with the right controller

There seems to be some difference between the joint_state_publisher and a ros2 controller and maybe they can't both be there?
